You can change 'top' to 'recent' and '0' to any number to filter through pages.
### ScoreSaber Profile

You can change the player ID's to match anyone's.

### BeatSavior Recent Songs
https://www.beatsavior.io/api/livescores/player/3032736043471367
You have to filter carefully throught it, as there is a lot of info, but it's worth it.
Again, the player ID can be changed, but the player has to have the BeatSavior mod installed.
